    I am a large carnivore ecologist with a particular interest in spatial ecology, animal movement, feeding ecology, and species interaction (prey-predator and predator-predator).
    I am particularly interested at the moment in how human disturbance can shape the distribution of species (in the form of human activity and land use) and their ecological interactions. </p>

    I am currently a PhD student at the FEM/CRI in the Applied Ecology group. The PhD project, which will address relevant questions and proposed applied actions for the conservation of the brown bear population in Central-Eastern Alps, is co-funded by the University of Trento, Fondazione Edmund Mach, and Stelvio NP. </p>
