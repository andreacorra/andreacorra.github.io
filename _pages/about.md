**Hello!**

My name is

My current thesis research is 


Originally from Italy, 

Before starting my Ph.D at University of Trento, Italy, I was a 


I am a large carnivore ecologist with a particular interest in spatial ecology, animal movement, and species interaction (prey-predator and predator-predator). I am also particularly interested in how human disturbance can shape species distribution (in the form of human activity, forest management and land use) and their ecological interactions.

I completed my Master degree in Wildlife Management at the University of Florence (Thesis title: "Wolf (Canis lupus) in Romania: winter feeding ecology and spatial interaction with lynx (Lynx lynx)"). I then collaborated and worked for three years in an EU co-funded project (LIFE13 NAT/RO/000205).

I started my PhD in 2017, and I am currently a PhD student at the FEM/CRI in the Applied Ecology group. The PhD project, which will address relevant questions and proposed applied actions for the conservation of the brown bear population in Central-Eastern Alps, is co-funded by the University of Trento, Fondazione Edmund Mach, and Stelvio National Park.

PhD project: Ecological connectivity in the Alpine anthropic matrix: natural reserves and corridors for the conservation of brown bear in the Alps (ABC - AlpBearConnect).

FEM Department and supervisor : Department of Biodiversity & Molecular Ecology (DBEM), group of Applied Ecologym, Dr. Francesca Cagnacci.
