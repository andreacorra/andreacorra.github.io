**Ciao!**
  
My name is Andrea Corradini, I am a carnivore ecologist and Ph.D. student at the University of Trento and the Fondazione Edmund Mach [Applied Ecology](https://www.fmach.it/CRI/info-generali/organizzazione/Direzione-Centro-Ricerca-e-Innovazione/Biodiversita-ed-ecologia-molecolare/Ecologia-applicata/FRANCESCA-CAGNACCI), Italy.

I am broadly interested in large carnivore ecology and conservation. Particularly, I have focused my studies on grey wolf, brown bear, and Eurasian lynx in the last years. My current main research addresses relevant questions and proposes measures for the conservation of the brown bear population in Central-Eastern Alps. My Ph.D. project started in 2017 and is co-funded by the University of Trento, Fondazione Edmund Mach, and Stelvio National Park.

Originally from Italy, I grew up between the rolling hills of Macerata and the Umbrian-Marches Apennines. I moved to Firenze in 2009 to pursue academic studies at the University of Florence, Italy, where I received my [B.Sc.](https://www.lfau.unifi.it/changelang-eng.html) and [M.Sc.](https://www.magistralefaunistica.unifi.it/changelang-eng.html) degrees in Wildlife Management. Meanwhile, I studied for a semester at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences [SLU](https://www.slu.se/en/departments/wildlife-fish-environmental-studies/) in Ume√•, Sweden, and enjoyed food, friends, and university life in one of the world's finest cities, Firenze. 

From 2014 (and after graduating), I collaborated and worked in an EU co-funded project ([LIFE13 NAT/RO/000205](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=4970)) in Romania. In winter, my collegues and I followed wolf tracks in the snow, deployed camera traps, and collected genetic samples. In summer, we performed wolf-howling surveys, interviewed shepherd, and carried out pellet group-count (to estimate ungulate density). After ~5,000 km surveyed by feet, ~2,000 wolf signs collected, and ~1,100 camera trapping days, our methodology has been accepted by the Ministery of the Environmet and has become the **first** National [action plan](https://www.wolflife.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Plan-de-Actiune-National-Specia-Lup-LIFE13NAT000205-WOLFLIFE.pdf)! 

In 2017, at the end of the WOLFLIFE project, I won a fully funded Ph.D. position and moved in the Alps, where I have lived since.
