# Grey wolf

## WOLFLIFE project
![wolf on display](/assets/images/lup.jpg)

The WOLFLIFE (**LIFE13 NAT/RO/000205**) was co-funded by the European Commission through the LIFE+ Nature program and was carried out between July 2014 and April 2018. The project's aim was to implement best practices for in-situ conservation of the species Canis lupus in the Eastern Carpathians.


**ACHIEVEMENT**  
- The project had a significant impact on wolf conservation in Romania- [see news](https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/news/coexistence-wolves-changing-romania) by European Commission.
- The methodology developed and applied in the WOLFLIFE project (2014-2017) has been accepted by the Ministery of the Environment and has become the first [National action plan](http://www.anpm.ro/-/om-626-2018-planul-national-de-actiune-pentru-specia-canis-lupus) on wolf in Romania!
- the WOLFLIFE project has been [listed](https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/news/2020-life-awards-finalists-announced) among the most innovative, inspirational and effective LIFE projects in nature protection in Europe!

The grey wolf (*Canis lupus*) has one of the widest distributions among terrestrial mammals. Flexible and opportunist, it is well adapted to the different types of habitats, therefore, complex predator-prey interactions occur throughout its entire range. Understanding the extent of these interactions can be achieved through an exhaustive analysis of an adequate number of existing studies on wolves’ feeding ecology. Access to those studies is often hindered by, among other factors, language barriers, and overcoming such factors would ensure the premises for knowledge development concerning the wolf’s foraging behaviour. Consequently, this information could support other research areas such as human-wildlife conflicts, disease transmission, and game management.

We present an [**Open Access spatial database**](https://github.com/andreacorra/wolfdiet) that contains bibliographic information on wolf’s diet throughout the species range. The database is developed in PostgreSQL and is currently being enhanced and updated. The diet information is freely accessible in R, Excel, or GIS environment.

The aim is to encourage researchers to engage in data collection, foster collaboration, and emphasize the knowledge about wolf foraging habits. Ultimately, we want to make it available in other languages (e.g. Chinese, Russian, Hindi) to facilitate knowledge sharing worldwide.

Any researcher interested in collaborating could directly contact the authors via [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/wolfdiet) or [email us](mailto:worldwolfdiet@gmail.com)

# Eurasian lynx

## EUROLYNX

The [EUROLYNX](https://www.eurolynx.org/) consortium is an open, bottom-up scientific network to promote collaborative science based on knowledge and data sharing to investigate the ecology of the Eurasian lynx (_Lynx lynx_). 23 research groups are currently collaborating and sharing a wide range of data (GPS data, activity, population, camera trapping) for research purposes.

Within the network, with a work led by PhD student [Teresa Oliveira](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Teresa_Oliveira16), we are developing a database to study lynx's feeding ecology and effects of kleptoparasitism on lynx predation.

## Romanian lynx
The lynx data collected during the WOLFLIFE project (genatic samples, tracks, and videos) was taken into account during the [LIFELYNX](https://www.lifelynx.eu/) project planning (in which I am unfortunately not involved as I moved to Trento after securing the PhD scholarship). Furthermore, the same spatial information have been used to assess [habitat selection](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320170268_Assessing_habitat_selection_of_wolf_Canis_lupus_and_lynx_Lynx_lynx_using_the_Ecological-Niche_Factor_Analysis_an_application_in_the_Eastern_Carpathians_Romania) and the [spatial interaction](https://zenodo.org/record/3689284) with wolf in the Romanian Carpathians.

# Other research projects

## Migration across scales
Lead by PhD student [Steffen Mumme](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steffen_Mumme), the project aims at characterizing individual and population movement patterns comparing elk and red deer migration across Europe and the Greater Yellowstone. The project is based on animal biotelemetry data that was collected within the [EUREDDEER](http://eureddeer.org/) consortium and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The first manuscript is in preparation. 

## Roe deer connectivity in the Alps
Lead by PhD student [Gieole Passoni](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gioele_Passoni), the work (within the larger [project](https://www.researchgate.net/project/PhD-Multi-species-animal-movement-and-connectivity-in-the-Alps) on animal connectivity) aims to investigate movement and ecological connectivity for roe deer in the Alps. The project uses the movement data within the [EURODEER](https://eurodeer.org/) consortium and the manuscript is currently in preparation.  

## mecoco
The [**mecoco**](https://mecoco.github.io/) (**me**thod **co**mparison **co**llaboration) initiative is a collaborative project which aims at developing quantitative analyses in ecology, evolution and related research fields.

I am participating in the [**ame1 project**](https://mecoco.github.io/ame1.html) with my colleagues in the Edmund Mach Foundation. This project focus on methods to quantify home range and activity for roe deer, based on animal biotelemetry data that was collected within the [EURODEER](https://eurodeer.org/) consortium. About 25 research teams joined the ame1 project and it is expected to be finalized in 2021.
