# Other research projects

## Migration across scales
Lead by PhD student [Steffen Mumme](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steffen_Mumme), the project aims at characterizing individual and population movement patterns comparing elk and red deer migration across Europe and the Greater Yellowstone. The project is based on animal biotelemetry data that was collected within the [EUREDDEER](http://eureddeer.org/) consortium and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The first manuscript is in preparation. 

## Roe deer connectivity in the Alps
Lead by PhD student [Gieole Passoni](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gioele_Passoni), the work (within the larger [project](https://www.researchgate.net/project/PhD-Multi-species-animal-movement-and-connectivity-in-the-Alps) on animal connectivity) aims to investigate movement and ecological connectivity for roe deer in the Alps. The project uses the movement data within the [EURODEER](https://eurodeer.org/) consortium and the manuscript is currently in preparation.  

## mecoco
The [**mecoco**](https://mecoco.github.io/) (**me**thod **co**mparison **co**llaboration) initiative is a collaborative project which aims at developing quantitative analyses in ecology, evolution and related research fields.

I am participating in the [**ame1 project**](https://mecoco.github.io/ame1.html) with my colleagues in the Edmund Mach Foundation. This project focus on methods to quantify home range and activity for roe deer, based on animal biotelemetry data that was collected within the [EURODEER](https://eurodeer.org/) consortium. About 25 research teams joined the ame1 project and it is expected to be finalized in 2021.
