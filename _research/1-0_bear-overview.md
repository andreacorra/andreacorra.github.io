The most important feature of a charge controller is the power stage, which can be either a DC/DC converter or 
just a switch between the solar panel and the battery. In case of the DC/DC converter, the charge controller 
can adapt to the input voltage of the solar panel and thus operate it in its optimum conditions. 
This is called a maximum power point tracker (MPPT). In contrast to that, the more simple PWM charge controller 
(named after its pulse-width modulated switch) can only connect or disconnect the solar panel from the battery.
